# Machine Learning Basics Portfolio

## 🚀 About This Project
This repository contains fundamental concepts and code for getting started with Machine Learning using Python. It includes essential steps such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📂 Project Structure
1. **Importing Libraries** - Load essential ML libraries.
2. **Loading and Exploring Data** - Read and analyze datasets.
3. **Data Preprocessing** - Handle missing values and encode categorical data.
4. **Splitting Data** - Divide data into training and testing sets.
5. **Feature Scaling** - Normalize numerical features.
6. **Training a Model** - Implement basic ML models like Linear Regression.
7. **Making Predictions** - Use the trained model to predict outcomes.
8. **Evaluating the Model** - Assess performance using error metrics.
9. **Data Visualization** - Visualize patterns and model performance.
10. **Classification Example** - Apply Logistic Regression for classification tasks.
